# IRIS-FLOWER CLASSIFICATION (LOGISTIC REGRESSION)
The Iris Flower Classification project uses machine learning to predict Iris species based on petal and sepal measurements. It demonstrates practical applications of data science through Python, Pandas and Flask for web deployment.
# Dataset Columns:
## a) Sepal Length (cm):The length of the sepal, the outermost part of the flower.
## b) Sepal Width (cm):The width of the sepal, providing additional information about the flower's structure.
## c) Petal Length (cm):The length of the petal, the inner, colorful part of the flower.
## d) Petal Width(cm):The width of the petal, helps distinguish between different species of Iris flowers.
## e) Species:Setosa,Versicolor,Virginica.
# Logistic Regression:
In the Iris Flower Classification project, logistic regression will predict Iris species by modeling the relationship between the dimensions of petals and sepals.
