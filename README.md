# IRIS-FLOWER CLASSIFICATION (LOGISTIC REGRESSION)
### The Iris Flower Classification project uses machine learning to predict Iris species based on petal and sepal measurements. It demonstrates practical applications of data science through Python, Pandas and Flask for web deployment.
## Dataset Columns:
### The Iris dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of 150 samples with 4 features, providing a rich and balanced dataset for species classification.
### a)Sepal Length(cm):The length of the sepal,the outermost part of the flower.
### b)Sepal Width(cm):The width of the sepal,providing additional information about flower's structure.
### c)Petal Length(cm):The length of teh petal,the inner,colorful part of the flower.
### d)Petal Width(cm):The width of the petal,helps distinguish between different species of iris flower.
### e)Species:Setosa,Versicolor,Virginica
## Logistic Regression:
### In the Iris Flower Classification project, logistic regression will predict Iris species by modeling the relationship between the dimensions of petals and sepals. This is one of the basic machine learning algorithms for doing binary classification tasks, like the prediction of species based on measures given.
